            <p class="bucket-list-facts">From kick the bucket (“to die”) + list, hence a 
            “list of things to do before you die”. The term was coined by American 
            and British screenwriter Justin Zackham in his screenplay for the 2007 
            film The Bucket List.[1] Zackham had created his own list called “Justin’s 
            List of Things to Do Before I Kick the Bucket” which he then shortened to 
            “Justin’s Bucket List”. The first item on his list was to have a 
            screenplay produced at a major Hollywood studio. After a time, it occurred to 
            him that the notion of a “bucket list” could itself be fodder for a film, so he 
            wrote a screenplay about two dying men racing to complete their own bucket lists 
            with the time they had left. Articles about the movie are the earliest 
            known uses.</p></section>
